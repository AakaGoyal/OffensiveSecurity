<h1> PENETRATION TEST REPORT- Security Assessment of Infrastructure and Operating System Services </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Following a recent security breach, a complete security review of the IT infrastructure was organized. While a dedicated team assessed 
web applications and databases, this report focuses on evaluating the security posture of the Operating systems and related infrastructure 
services deployed. 

Various penetration tests were conducted to simulate real-world attack scenarios, aligned with the EC-Council's Certified Ethical Hacker 
(CEH) Hacking Methodology (CHM) [EC-Council, 2022] to identify vulnerabilities. 

Four critical vulnerabilities were analyzed: 
1. UnrealIRCd Backdoor Exploitation (CVE-2010-2075) (NIST, 2010) 
2. Drupalgeddon2 Exploitation on Drupal 7 (CVE-2018-7600) (NIST, 2018a) 
3. Apache HTTPD 2.4.7 Remote Code Execution Attempt (CVE-2021-40438) (NIST, 2021) 
4. OpenSSH User Enumeration (CVE-2018-15473) (NIST, 2018b) 
Remediations are listed in the ‘Detailed Findings and Walkthrough ‘section of the report. It is recommended to address the identified 
risks and improve the overall security posture.
